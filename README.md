# FootballComputerVision
Coding challenge for  AI Engineer position

Description: Using Python and OpenCV library created a way to detect the QB
position in American Football by processing frames from a video.

Currently uses color detection since the video footage aquired has the qb wearing red.

will attempt to implement a number detection algorithm to detect the number of the qb
and track through that.

To Run: change the static video name in the following piece of code
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('video_name'). Then run as so python QBtracker.py
